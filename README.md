# Credit-card-Data-Visualization

This project visualizes Credit Card Data using Python's matplotlib and seaborn libraries. The dashboard includes multiple plots to analyze credit card transactions, customer categories, and spending patterns.

## Visualizations

1. **Bivariate Plot: Credit Card Limit vs. Average Purchase**
   - **Type**: Scatter Plot
   - **Purpose**: Visualize the relationship between credit card limit and average purchase.
   - **Insight**: Identify potential correlations between these two variables.

2. **Distribution of Credit Card Limit and Average Purchase**
   - **Type**: Histogram and Box Plot
   - **Purpose**: 
     - Histograms to show the frequency distribution of credit limits and average purchases.
     - Box plots to identify outliers and data spread.
   - **Insight**: Understand data distribution and spot anomalies.

3. **Number of Customers in Each Income Group**
   - **Type**: Bar Chart
   - **Purpose**: Visualize the distribution of customers across different income groups.
   - **Insight**: Identify income group segments and their relative sizes.

4. **Frequency Distribution of Total Transaction Amount**
   - **Type**: Histogram
   - **Purpose**: Show the frequency of different total transaction amounts.
   - **Insight**: Understand how transaction amounts vary across customers.

5. **Customer Retention and Attrition**
   - **Type**: Pie Chart with Exploded Slice
   - **Purpose**: Show the proportion of retained and attrited customers.
   - **Insight**: Highlight attrition rates and emphasize customer churn.
